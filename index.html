  <h1>Generative Quilting</h1>

    This project utilizes generative art techniques to create textures and patterns that are reminiscent to fabric from existing images. 
    What began as a simple programming error has evolved to what I call <i>generative quilting</i>. I stumbled across this effect when trying to 
    algorithmically recreate the timelapse of <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/place/comments/txufad/the_complete_rplace_timelapse/">r/place</a>, a social experiment ran by Reddit in April 2022 where users "battled" to fill 
    a blank canvas with one pixel at a time. 
  </p>

  <p>
    The r/place image gives a canvas of correlated but seemingly random colours. If we used the canvas in realtime, 
    (assuming there are no predetermined bots placing pixels - which there were a lot of) the array of integer values representing colour
    could be a source of decent randomness. There were millions of users competing to fill spaces in realtime, no one canvas would be replicated
    by the next (maybe). 
  </p>
  <p>
    Building on the representation of images, they are just an array of numbers representing each pixel. Starting in the top left corner we have
    (x,y) = (0,0) coordinates. <a href="https://processing.org/tutorials/pixels">This tutorial</a> explains images and pixels really well. Basically, if 
    we wish to access an arbitrary (x,y) pixel within the image, we need to properly offset into the 1-dimensional array. Here is the formula:
  </p>

  <div class="code-snippet">
    <code>
      let offset := x + y * width;  
      <br><br>
      // this is the pixel @ (x,y) <br>
      let pixel := image[offset];
    </code>
  </div>

  <p>
    Now heres where my programming error came in. I had accidentally added a coefficient to the Y offset:
  </p>

  <div class="code-snippet">
    <code>
      let yM := random(height); <br><br>
      // where yM is a random multiplier <br><br>
      let offset := x + (y * yM) * width;
      <br><br>
      ...
      <br><br>
      // we an also add an x multiplier<br>
      let offset := (x * xM) + (y * yM) * width;  
    </code>
  </div>

  <p>
    If we recreate the r/place image by iterating through the original, pixel by pixel and apply randomly chosen multipliers we end up with 
    images which contain textures similar to fabric.

    I wanted to see how closely I could imitate woven fabric so I fiddled with different multipliers and seed images until I 
    recreated the look of denim algorithmically. The first image below is the seed image, followed by the output from the algorithm, and finally 
    a real life comparison.

  <p>
    Now I wanted to go even further with this algorithm and here is where the quilting comes in. If we split the image into a 
    series of sub-images and apply the fabric algorithm to each of them individually we can make "patches" and the outputted image
    looks as if it was quilted. Its not perfect, but I see it as a combination of pixelation and texture which mimics the quilt look.
    This page comes equipped with numerous test images so each page refresh there is a chance a different image will be quilted. All quilted images
    are my own.
